# OOP-PLP-
# Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️

Hey everyone! For this first assignment, we're diving into creating our own Python classes – pretty cool, right?

## The Task

The goal is to build a Python class that represents something *we* choose! It could be anything that comes to mind. To get the ball rolling, here are a few ideas our tutors suggested:

* A Smartphone 📱 (think about its specs and what it can do!)
* A Book 📚 (title, author, how many pages, what genre?)
* A Superhero 🦸 (powers, secret identity, that awesome catchphrase!)

Basically, we need to come up with something interesting and bring it to life with code!

## What We Need to Do

* **Make a Class:** We've got to define a Python class for whatever we pick.
* **Give it Stuff (Attributes):** We need to add attributes that describe our chosen thing.
* **Make it Do Things (Methods):** We'll also need to add methods that define what our objects can do.
* **Set it Up Right (Constructors - `__init__`)**: When we create a new object, it should start with its own unique values. This is where the constructor comes in!
* **Bonus Challenge (Inheritance):** If we want to go the extra mile, we can play around with inheritance. This means creating a base class and then some more specific classes that build on it. We could show off:
    * **Polymorphism:** Where different classes can do the same thing (method) but in their own way.
    * **Encapsulation:** Where we can tweak or add to what the main class does in the other classes, while keeping some things protected.

## Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭

This part is all about showing off polymorphism!

### The Goal

We need to create a program with different animal or vehicle classes. The catch is they all need to have a common action (like `move()`), but each class should do it differently.

### For Example

Think about how different things move:

* A `Car` would `move()` by printing: `"Driving" 🚗`
* A `Plane` would `move()` by printing: `"Flying" ✈️`
* A `Dog` would `move()` by printing: `"Running" 🐕`

Our program should show that when we tell each of these to `move()`, they do it in their own specific way.

## How to Tackle This

1.  **Pick Your Class:** Decide what you want to model for the first part.
2.  **Plan it Out:** What are its key features and actions?
3.  **Write the Code:** Let's get coding the Python class! Don't forget the constructor and methods.
4.  **(Optional) Inheritance Time:** If you're up for it, design your base and derived classes.
5.  **Polymorphism Power:** Create your animal or vehicle classes with that shared `move()` method, making sure each one does its own thing.
6.  **Test Everything:** Gotta make sure it all works as expected!


Let's get coding and make some awesome classes! 💪
